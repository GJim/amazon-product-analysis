      "text": "It does have a 10\" lid but it is only 7\" deep. So, it is hard to compare to a larger size. I was planning on getting a graduated set, but it appears it is the only size of Amazon Basics. It is a nice pot and works on my induction stove top. To bad it is mislabeled as 9.56\" deep. So, not sure what the Quarts is.",

I bought this product in a rush because I did not have time to go to the store and needed it the next day to make a BIG potion of chicken soup. Upon arrival I could not believe that this was an amazon brand. I had to double check the box it came in because of the quality of the pot. I felt like it was one of my other brand pots I own.The handles DO NOT get hot at all while cooking. I think this was one of my worries while looking for a pot.",

      "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars",
      "text": "Ich bin absolut begeistert von diesem Edelstahl-Suppentopf! Mit einem Fassungsverm\u00f6gen von 7,6 Litern ist er perfekt f\u00fcr gro\u00dfe Suppen, Eint\u00f6pfe oder auch zum Kochen f\u00fcr die ganze Familie. Der Topf ist aus hochwertigem Edelstahl gefertigt, was ihn nicht nur besonders robust, sondern auch leicht zu reinigen macht. Nach dem Kochen sieht er immer noch aus wie neu \u2013 kein Anhaften oder Verf\u00e4rben, was ich bei g\u00fcnstigeren T\u00f6pfen oft erlebt habe.Der Deckel passt perfekt und h\u00e4lt die W\u00e4rme hervorragend, was das Kochen noch effizienter macht. Besonders praktisch ist der Griff, der stabil und ergonomisch ist, sodass man den Topf auch bei vollem Inhalt sicher anheben kann. Der Boden ist gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig und verteilt die Hitze gut, was zu einer optimalen Garung f\u00fchrt.Der Suppentopf eignet sich auch f\u00fcr alle Herdarten, inklusive Induktion, was ihn sehr vielseitig macht. Ich kann dieses Produkt nur w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen \u2013 es ist ein echtes Must-Have in jeder K\u00fcche!",
